Github supports code fencing, allowing nultiple line of code:

int main ()
{
    printf ("Hello World");
    return 0;
}
```

Code with syntax highlighting (just include the name of the language)

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main ()
{
    printf ("Hello World");
    return 0;
}
```

... or use embedded link to code
